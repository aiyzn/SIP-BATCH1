		<h1>STORY</h1>
			<p>Carmen's life took a tumultuous turn when she fell into drug use at a young age in her hometown barangay in Cagayan de Oro. Despite trying to escape the drug environment and achieving ten years of sobriety in Manila, she relapsed after returning to her hometown and marrying her second husband, who was also involved in drugs. In 2017, she was put on a watch list and given the opportunity to attend a Community-Based Drug Rehabilitation (CBDR) program as part of the Philippine Government's anti-drug campaign.</p>
			<br>
			<p>During the six-month CBDR sessions, Carmen learned valuable skills to manage her cravings and understand the impact of drugs on her life. With the support of USAID's RenewHealth Project, she successfully transformed her life, becoming a certified community facilitator and dedicating herself to helping others on their recovery journeys. Her journey, shared through the treatment booklet, became an inspiration for thousands across the Philippines, showcasing the possibility of positive change through CBDR. Carmen's story became a testament to the power of second chances and the belief that change is achievable, no matter the challenges faced.</p>
