		<h1>STORY</h1>
			<p>Carmen's life took a tumultuous turn when she fell into drug use at a young age in her hometown barangay in Cagayan de Oro. Despite trying to escape the drug environment and achieving ten years of sobriety in Manila, she relapsed after returning to her hometown and marrying her second husband, who was also involved in drugs. In 2017, she was put on a watch list and given the opportunity to attend a Community-Based Drug Rehabilitation (CBDR) program as part of the Philippine Government's anti-drug campaign.</p>
			<br>
			<p>During the six-month CBDR sessions, Carmen learned valuable skills to manage her cravings and understand the impact of drugs on her life. With the support of USAID's RenewHealth Project, she successfully transformed her life, becoming a certified community facilitator and dedicating herself to helping others on their recovery journeys. Her journey, shared through the treatment booklet, became an inspiration for thousands across the Philippines, showcasing the possibility of positive change through CBDR. Carmen's story became a testament to the power of second chances and the belief that change is achievable, no matter the challenges faced.</p>

		<h1>Drug Addiction: A Looming Menace on Society</h1>
		<p>Drug addiction remains one of the most pressing issues in contemporary society. Throughout time, people have turned to drug use for a variety of different reasons and these reasons may vary from person to person. The root causes of drug addiction involve a combination of biological, environmental, and social factors. Thus, affecting people of all ages, genders, races, and socioeconomic statuses.</p>

		<p>Many times people use drugs because they want to get “high.” They hear about its euphoric effects and they feel the urge to use them despite the risk of addiction. Other factors such as self-medication, curiosity, and peer pressure are on the list of why people tend to use these substances.</p>

		<p>Addicted individuals often struggle with maintaining relationships, performing well academically or professionally, and meeting personal responsibilities. According to The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), a drug addict will experience sickness, anxiety, and irritability when failing to use drugs. The withdrawal symptoms sometimes become extremely severe that the individual must use the substance again to counteract the side effects. Because of this, drugs such as Meth, Marijuana, and cocaine are being abused by many without prior knowledge of their side effects.</p>

		<p>In the recent report of Philstar, Methamphetamine hydrochloride or "shabu" remains the most commonly used illegal drug in the country, especially among low-income communities that comprise the majority of the population, earning its title of  “poor man's cocaine”.  However, along with its popularity comes its harmful effects on one’s body. Tolerance to methamphetamine’s pleasurable effects develops when it is taken repeatedly. It can cause long-term damage, especially to a person’s body and brain.  Moreover,  this substance can lead to varying health problems such as dental problems, skin sores, and respiratory illnesses. It may also severely damage the brain leading to memory loss, paranoia, and even psychosis. </p>

		<p>Furthermore, Marijuana a mild hallucinogen, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, is the second most abused drug in the Philippines, next to Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (Shabu).</p>

		<p>According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana acts as a central nervous system stimulant.  It can stimulate the nervous system enough that some people become paranoid while taking it. At the same time, marijuana can dull memory, making it harder to concentrate or remember things. Habitual marijuana use can lead to heart disease and other cardiovascular problems. </p>

		<p> commonly abused substances such as alcohol, cocaine, and heroin are also very destructive types of drugs. The aforementioned drugs are all psychoactive substances that can alter brain function and behavior when consumed. All three substances pose health risks to users. Alcohol abuse can lead to liver damage, cardiovascular problems, and neurological issues. Cocaine use can cause heart problems, respiratory issues, and psychological disturbances. Heroin use can lead to respiratory depression, infections, and an increased risk of overdose.</p>

		<p>The stigma surrounding drug addiction remains a significant barrier to effective treatment and support. Treating drug addiction requires a comprehensive and individualized approach and understanding the nature of these drugs is one step in preventing future substance dependence among the youth.</p>
