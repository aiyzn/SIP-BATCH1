		<h1>Blocking the Path: The Gateways to Drugs 
			and Why We Should Close Them</h1>
		<p>
	A significant effort in the substance abuse prevention cause is cutting off all access to and motivations to seek out illegal drugs. However, substance abuse is not restricted to white powders in pocket-sized plastic and exchanges under the table – the potential harm of gateway drugs is still an ever present threat to the population, especially the hopeful youth in the country. </p>

<p class="bold-p">The Gateway Theory</p>

	<p>The term “gateway drugs” has been used to refer to cigarettes, alcohol, and other common legal substances since the 1970s and 1980s due to the popularized “gateway theory” (American Addiction Centers, 2022). It suggests that an adolescent’s fixation, dependence, or affinity to substances like tobacco and alcohol may translate into a more debilitating connection with more addictive illegal drugs in their adulthood (Nkansah-Amankra & Minelli, 2016).</p>

	<p>Although correlation is not causation, there is reason to believe that frequent use of gateway drugs seem to be the first step in the all-consuming journey of substance abuse. Experimentation in the validity of the gateway theory has been performed by various researchers through the years. Mayet et al. (2012) observed that among 17-year olds in a military exercise in France, initiating one drug increased the risk of initiating another. A following study by Mayet et al. (2012) also observed that daily tobacco use among adolescents is strongly associated with cannabis use and other illicit drugs.</p>

	<p>Previous association and affinity for other substances is closely related to drug dependence – in a study of cross national comparisons of 17 countries, it was determined that prior drug use and age of onset are the most dominant factors (Degenhardt et al., 2010).</p>

<p class="bold-p">The Reason Behind the Thrill</p>

	<p>Kirby and Barry (2012) suggest that drug dependence may also occur with the initial drug experimentation of commonly available legal substances. In the Philippines, all forms of tobacco are legal and available (cigarettes, vape, and cigars are common examples) to those who wish to access them, but continual use over an increased period of time may contribute to forming substance use disorders (Deza, 2015).</p>

	<p>However, knowing that they are “bad for the health” and may encourage and enable a more harmful form of dependence in the future, users and consumers of gateway drugs in the Philippines are not deterred by the threats. The satisfaction that can be earned by a smoke, a shot, or a stick are difficult to combat.</p>

<p class="bold-p">After the Relief</p>

	<p>According to American Addiction Centers (2012), “a gateway drug alters the neuropathways in the brain.” These effects attack in different ways depending on the gateway drug, and the most common forms of these are nicotine from tobacco and alcohol.</p>

<p class="bold-p">Nicotine</p>

<p>Nicotine is a psychoactive and addictive substance that is a main component in tobacco products. Smoking nicotine depends on the subjective satisfaction acquired from it, but continued exposure to the substance may influence the brain area that is responsible for executive functions and attention performance – the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Smoking, especially during adolescence, increases the risk of acquiring psychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment in adulthood, and attention deficits that may aggravate with age (Goriounova & Mansvelder, 2012).</p>

<p>Aside from the brain scars of continued smoking, tobacco smoking also boasts of being the culprit of 6 million deaths worldwide. Tobacco smoke contains carcinogens as well as many other toxic chemicals, and it can cause lung cancer and a wide array of respiratory diseases not only for smokers but for the people around them (West, 2017).</p>

<p>Despite the wide array of side effects that come with continued smoking, the use of tobacco even among adolescents persists to this day. According to Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (2023), 19.5% of the Filipino population are smokers, while 12.5% of youth ages 13-15 are current tobacco users despite them being aware of the harm that comes with smoking. This might be due to the immediate reinforcement and subjective satisfaction acquired after every smoking session.
</p>

<p>Most smokers tell of a calmed feeling that empowers them after a smoking session. Although little evidence suggests that nicotine provides self medication for adverse mood states or stress relief, it activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs) in the brain and induces the release of dopamine, commonly known as one of the happy hormones. Nicotine is also a psychomotor stimulant, and it can speed up simple reaction time and improve performance in new users. However, it builds tolerance, and the desired effect may not be acquired with the same dosage after a significant period of time (Jarvis, 2004).</p> 

<p class="bold-p">Alcohol</p>

	<p>Alcohol is one of the most addictive substances in the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 2.3 billion people around the world consume alcohol. In the Philippines alone, 4 in 10 adults are drinkers while 3 in 10 of the Filipino youth are known alcohol consumers (Movendi International, 2021; University of the Philippines, 2022).</p> 

	<p>Intoxication and sociability are the main effects of alcohol consumption, and it is the attractive feature of the substance that makes it widely demanded. However, continued consumption risks alcohol dependence and addiction (Nutt et al., 2021).</p> 

	<p>Alcohol affects the workings of the brain through interference with its communication pathways, making balance, memory, speech, and judgment difficult during intoxication. Long-term heavy drinking may cause reduction in the size of neurons, which can heavily affect the efficiency of the brain, and adolescent brains are more vulnerable to this damage than adult brains. Blackouts are also a common occurrence during intoxication, and these are gaps of memory that can introduce a wide array of damage, injury, and trauma to the consumer (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2022).</p> 

	<p>Other than the injuries, car accidents, and vulnerabilities that intoxication may cause in uncontrolled drinking, alcohol is also an underlying cause for 30 conditions and a contributor to many more. The most common disease categories include infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes, neuropsychiatric diseases (including alcohol use disorders), cardiovascular disease, liver and pancreas disease, and unintentional and intentional injury (Rehm, 2011).</p>

<p class="bold-p">Conclusion</p>

	<p>Most drinkers and smokers are aware of the harm that comes with their bad habits, and different people have different reasons for the vices they immerse in. However, for a better and healthier world, it is a national effort to sweep the country of these debilitating and harmful substances, one person at a time. As part of the Filipino youth, one of the best ways we can protect the next generation is to advocate against these substances ourselves.</p>

	<p>One hit, one shot, one stick not taken every single day are giant contributions we can make for a healthy and clean future.</p>

		<h1>Drug Addiction: A Looming Menace on Society</h1>
		<p>Drug addiction remains one of the most pressing issues in contemporary society. Throughout time, people have turned to drug use for a variety of different reasons and these reasons may vary from person to person. The root causes of drug addiction involve a combination of biological, environmental, and social factors. Thus, affecting people of all ages, genders, races, and socioeconomic statuses.</p>

		<p>Many times people use drugs because they want to get “high.” They hear about its euphoric effects and they feel the urge to use them despite the risk of addiction. Other factors such as self-medication, curiosity, and peer pressure are on the list of why people tend to use these substances.</p>

		<p>Addicted individuals often struggle with maintaining relationships, performing well academically or professionally, and meeting personal responsibilities. According to The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), a drug addict will experience sickness, anxiety, and irritability when failing to use drugs. The withdrawal symptoms sometimes become extremely severe that the individual must use the substance again to counteract the side effects. Because of this, drugs such as Meth, Marijuana, and cocaine are being abused by many without prior knowledge of their side effects.</p>

		<p>In the recent report of Philstar, Methamphetamine hydrochloride or "shabu" remains the most commonly used illegal drug in the country, especially among low-income communities that comprise the majority of the population, earning its title of  “poor man's cocaine”.  However, along with its popularity comes its harmful effects on one’s body. Tolerance to methamphetamine’s pleasurable effects develops when it is taken repeatedly. It can cause long-term damage, especially to a person’s body and brain.  Moreover,  this substance can lead to varying health problems such as dental problems, skin sores, and respiratory illnesses. It may also severely damage the brain leading to memory loss, paranoia, and even psychosis. </p>

		<p>Furthermore, Marijuana a mild hallucinogen, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, is the second most abused drug in the Philippines, next to Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (Shabu).</p>

		<p>According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana acts as a central nervous system stimulant.  It can stimulate the nervous system enough that some people become paranoid while taking it. At the same time, marijuana can dull memory, making it harder to concentrate or remember things. Habitual marijuana use can lead to heart disease and other cardiovascular problems. </p>

		<p> commonly abused substances such as alcohol, cocaine, and heroin are also very destructive types of drugs. The aforementioned drugs are all psychoactive substances that can alter brain function and behavior when consumed. All three substances pose health risks to users. Alcohol abuse can lead to liver damage, cardiovascular problems, and neurological issues. Cocaine use can cause heart problems, respiratory issues, and psychological disturbances. Heroin use can lead to respiratory depression, infections, and an increased risk of overdose.</p>

		<p>The stigma surrounding drug addiction remains a significant barrier to effective treatment and support. Treating drug addiction requires a comprehensive and individualized approach and understanding the nature of these drugs is one step in preventing future substance dependence among the youth.</p>
